# Introducing CodeVault

We're excited to announce CodeVault, a self-hosted AI coding assistant that brings the power of modern LLMs to your development workflow while keeping your code 100% private.

## Why we built CodeVault

As developers, we love AI coding assistants. They help us write better code faster. But we also care deeply about privacy and control. That's why we built CodeVault - to give you the best of both worlds.

## Key features

### GPU-Accelerated Inference

CodeVault leverages NVIDIA CUDA for blazing-fast inference. Whether you're running a 7B model on a single GPU or a 123B model across multiple GPUs, CodeVault delivers responsive completions.

### OpenAI-Compatible API

We've implemented an OpenAI-compatible API, so you can use CodeVault with your existing tools. VS Code, Cursor, Continue - they all work out of the box.

### Enterprise Ready

CodeVault isn't just for hobbyists. We've built enterprise features from day one:

- **Multi-tenancy** - Isolate teams with organizations
- **RBAC** - Admin, User, and Viewer roles
- **Audit logging** - Track every action for compliance
- **Monitoring** - Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards

## Getting started

Getting started is easy. Clone the repo, run the install script, and you're up in minutes:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YannBrrd/CodeVault.git
cd CodeVault && ./install.sh
```

Check out our [quick start guide](/docs/getting-started) for detailed instructions.

## What's next

We're just getting started. Here's what's on our roadmap:

- **VS Code extension** - Native extension with inline completions
- **JetBrains plugin** - Support for IntelliJ, PyCharm, and more
- **RAG pipeline** - Index your codebase for context-aware completions
- **Fine-tuning** - Train models on your coding standards

Stay tuned for updates, and happy coding!
