# Introducing CodeVault

We're excited to announce CodeVault, a private AI coding assistant that brings the power of modern LLMs to your development workflow while keeping your code 100% private.

## Why we built CodeVault

As developers, we love AI coding assistants. They help us write better code faster. But we also care deeply about privacy and control. Many organizations can't use cloud-based AI tools due to security policies or compliance requirements.

That's why we built CodeVault - to give you the best of both worlds. Enterprise-grade AI coding assistance, deployed on your infrastructure, managed by our team.

## Key features

### GPU-Accelerated Inference

CodeVault leverages NVIDIA CUDA for blazing-fast inference. Whether you're running DeepSeek V3 or Qwen 3, CodeVault delivers responsive completions optimized for your hardware.

### Choose Your Models

Select from the latest coding models like DeepSeek V3, Qwen 3, Devstral, and more. Want a different model? Just ask - we'll deploy and optimize it for your infrastructure.

### OpenAI-Compatible API

We've implemented an OpenAI-compatible API, so you can use CodeVault with your existing tools. VS Code, Cursor, Continue, JetBrains - they all work out of the box.

### Enterprise Ready

CodeVault is built for enterprise from day one:

- **Multi-tenancy** - Isolate teams with organizations
- **RBAC** - Admin, User, and Viewer roles
- **Audit logging** - Track every action for compliance
- **Dedicated support** - Our team is here to help

## Getting started

Getting started is simple:

1. **Contact us** to discuss your requirements
2. **We deploy** CodeVault on your infrastructure
3. **Configure your IDE** with the API endpoint we provide
4. **Start coding** with AI assistance

Check out our [quick start guide](/docs/getting-started) for more details.

## Your code stays private

With CodeVault, your code never leaves your infrastructure. All AI inference happens locally on your servers. No data is sent to external services. Complete privacy, complete control.
