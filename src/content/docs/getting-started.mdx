# Quick Start

After we deploy CodeVault on your infrastructure, here's how to start using it.

## Your API Endpoint

You'll receive a dedicated API endpoint after deployment:

```
https://codevault.your-company.com/v1
```

This endpoint is OpenAI-compatible, meaning it works with any tool that supports the OpenAI API.

## Configure Your IDE

### VS Code with Continue

1. Install the [Continue extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue)
2. Open Continue settings and add:

```json
{
  "models": [{
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "deepseek-v3",
    "apiBase": "https://codevault.your-company.com/v1",
    "apiKey": "your-api-key"
  }]
}
```

### Cursor

1. Open Settings > Models
2. Add a custom OpenAI-compatible model:
   - API Base: `https://codevault.your-company.com/v1`
   - API Key: Your provided API key
   - Model: `deepseek-v3` (or your deployed model)

### JetBrains IDEs

1. Install an AI assistant plugin (like Continue or CodeGPT)
2. Configure with your CodeVault endpoint

### Any OpenAI-Compatible Tool

```
API Base URL: https://codevault.your-company.com/v1
API Key: your-api-key
Model: deepseek-v3
```

## Test the API

```bash
curl https://codevault.your-company.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-v3",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a hello world in Python"}]
  }'
```

## Web Dashboard

Access the web dashboard at your deployment URL to:

- Chat with AI models directly
- Monitor usage and performance
- Manage API keys
- View available models
