# Fine-tuning

CodeVault supports fine-tuning models on your codebase to match your team's coding standards and conventions.

## Why Fine-tune?

Fine-tuning creates a model that:

- Matches your code style and conventions
- Understands your internal libraries and APIs
- Follows your documentation patterns
- Uses your preferred naming conventions

## How It Works

### 1. Data Preparation

We help you prepare training data from:

- Your existing codebase
- Pull request history
- Code review comments
- Documentation examples

### 2. Training

Using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):

- Efficient training on consumer GPUs
- Preserves base model knowledge
- Quick iteration cycles
- Multiple fine-tunes per base model

### 3. Deployment

Fine-tuned models are deployed alongside base models:

- Access via the same API
- Specify model name in requests
- A/B test against base models

## Training Data Examples

Good training examples include:

```markdown
### Input
Write a function to validate email addresses

### Output (your style)
def validate_email(email: str) -> bool:
    """
    Validate an email address format.

    Args:
        email: The email string to validate

    Returns:
        True if valid, False otherwise
    """
    import re
    pattern = r'^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+$'
    return bool(re.match(pattern, email))
```

## Best Practices

- **Quality over quantity** - 100 excellent examples beat 10,000 poor ones
- **Diverse examples** - Cover different scenarios and patterns
- **Consistent style** - All examples should follow the same conventions
- **Include context** - Show complete functions, not fragments

## Hardware Requirements

Fine-tuning requirements:

| Base Model | VRAM for Training |
|------------|-------------------|
| 7B | 16GB |
| 14B | 24GB |
| 32B | 48GB+ |

## Process

1. **Consultation** - Discuss your requirements and goals
2. **Data preparation** - We help curate training examples
3. **Training** - Run on your infrastructure
4. **Evaluation** - Test against your benchmarks
5. **Deployment** - Make available via API
