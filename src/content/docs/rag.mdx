# RAG Pipeline

CodeVault includes a powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline that indexes your codebase for context-aware completions.

## How It Works

1. **Indexing** - Your codebase is parsed and chunked into meaningful segments
2. **Embedding** - Code chunks are converted to vector embeddings
3. **Storage** - Embeddings are stored in a vector database
4. **Retrieval** - When you ask a question, relevant code is retrieved
5. **Generation** - Retrieved context is included in the prompt for accurate responses

## Benefits

- **Project-aware completions** - AI understands your specific codebase
- **Find usage patterns** - "How do we handle authentication?"
- **Cross-file understanding** - AI sees relationships between files
- **Documentation search** - Include markdown docs in the index

## Indexed Content

The RAG pipeline indexes:

- Source code files (all major languages)
- Markdown documentation
- Configuration files
- Test files
- Comments and docstrings

## Example Queries

With RAG enabled, you can ask:

- "How is the user authentication implemented?"
- "Show me examples of error handling in this project"
- "What's the pattern for database connections?"
- "Find all usages of the PaymentService class"

## Configuration

RAG is configured during deployment. Options include:

- **Repository paths** - Which directories to index
- **File filters** - Include/exclude patterns
- **Chunk size** - How code is segmented
- **Update frequency** - How often to re-index

## Privacy

All RAG processing happens on your infrastructure:

- Code never leaves your servers
- Embeddings are stored locally
- No external API calls for indexing
- Full control over indexed content

## Performance

RAG adds minimal latency:

- Initial indexing: Minutes to hours (depends on codebase size)
- Query retrieval: ~50-100ms
- Incremental updates: Seconds for changed files
