# API Key Management

CodeVault provides comprehensive API key management for secure access control.

## Creating API Keys

API keys are created through the web dashboard:

1. Log in to your CodeVault dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**
3. Click **Create New Key**
4. Set a name and optional expiration
5. Copy and securely store your key

API keys are only shown once at creation. Store them securely.

## Key Properties

Each API key has:

- **Name** - Descriptive identifier
- **Prefix** - Visible portion for identification (e.g., `cv_abc...`)
- **Created date** - When the key was generated
- **Last used** - Most recent API call
- **Expiration** - Optional expiry date

## Using API Keys

Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl https://codevault.your-company.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cv_your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "deepseek-v3", "messages": [...]}'
```

## Rate Limiting

Rate limits are configured per key:

- **Requests per minute** - Maximum API calls
- **Tokens per minute** - Maximum tokens processed

Exceeded limits return HTTP 429.

## Revoking Keys

To revoke an API key:

1. Go to **Settings > API Keys**
2. Find the key to revoke
3. Click **Revoke**
4. Confirm the action

Revoked keys are immediately invalidated.

## Best Practices

- Create separate keys for different applications
- Set expiration dates for temporary access
- Rotate keys regularly
- Never commit keys to version control
- Use environment variables in your code
